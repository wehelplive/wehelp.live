    description:
      There are many people who are <strong>ready to help</strong> and who
      <strong>need help</strong>. Existing organizations do not cope with
      coordination and chaos is formed and many issues remain unresolved. It
      is necessary to find and eliminate hatches in organizations, to link
      them together, to establish coordination in order to effectively cope
      with the existing situation.
