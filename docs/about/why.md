# Why are we doing it?

1. Refugees need accommodations, transfers, health, communication, education, jobs.
2. Volunteers need clear information where and how we can delegate refugees to other volunteers or organisations.
3. Volunteers need a clear and simple answer about what to do to help during the refugee crisis in the EU.
