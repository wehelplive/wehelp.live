# How are we different?

Agile flat structured organisation with artful participation.

# What, How, Why

- What? Solve complex problems that no one else solves in the Ukrainian refugee crisis.
- How? Performance, Consent, Empiricism, Continuous Development, Equivalence, Transparency, Responsibility.
- Why? There are many people who are ready to help and who need help. Existing organisations do not cope with coordination and chaos is formed. Many issues remain unresolved.
