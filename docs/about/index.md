# Why are we doing it?

1. Refugees need accommodations, transfers, health, communication, education, jobs.
2. Volunteers need clear information where and how we can delegate refugees to other volunteers or organisations.
3. Volunteers need a clear and simple answer about what to do to help during the refugee crisis in the EU.

# How are we different?

Agile flat structured organisation with artful participation.

# What, How, Why

- What? Solve complex problems that no one else solves in the Ukrainian refugee crisis.
- How? Performance, Consent, Empiricism, Continuous Development, Equivalence, Transparency, Responsibility.
- Why? There are many people who are ready to help and who need help. Existing organisations do not cope with coordination and chaos is formed. Many issues remain unresolved.

# Our Roadmap

- 5 Years: Our services is used worldwide by millions of volunteers and refugees.
- 10 Years: Major disaster relief and non-profit orgs (like Red Cross, Caritas) worked with us as strategic partners to solve complex problems with our expert teams
- 15 Years: WeHelp is known worldwide as the most successful organization in solving complex problems and having the best experts (just like NASA, WHO and SpaceX)

- Effectiveness

- Consent
  Raise, seek out and resolve objections to decisions and actions, so that you can reduce the potential for undesirable consequences and discover worthwhile ways to improve.

- Empiricism
  Test all assumptions you rely on through experiments and continuous revision, so that you learn fast, make sense of things and navigate complexity as effectively as you can.

- Continuous Improvement
  Regularly review the outcome of what you are doing, and then make incremental improvements to what you do and how you do it based on what you learn, so that you can adapt to changes when necessary, and maintain or improve effectiveness over time.

- Equivalence
  Involve people in making and evolving decisions that affect them, so that you increase engagement and accountability, and make use of the distributed intelligence toward achieving and evolving your objectives.

- Transparency
  Record all information that is valuable for the organization and make it accessible to everyone in the organization, unless there is a reason for confidentiality, so that everyone has the information they need to understand how to do their work in a way that contributes most effectively to the whole.
  [Read more](https://patterns.sociocracy30.org/principle-transparency.html)
- Accountability
  Respond when something is needed, do what you agreed to do, and accept your share of responsibility for the course of the organization, so that what needs doing gets done, nothing is overlooked and everyone does what they can to contribute toward the effectiveness and integrity of the organization.
