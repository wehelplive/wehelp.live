          There are many people who are <strong>ready to help</strong> and who
          <strong>need help</strong>. Existing organizations do not cope with
          coordination and chaos is formed and many issues remain unresolved. It
          is necessary to find and eliminate hatches in organizations, to link
          them together, to establish coordination in order to effectively cope
          with the existing situation.
